About This Repository
=================

Welcome to my repository dedicated to practicing computer science algorithms using Python. As an enthusiast in this field, I've delved into algorithmic concepts by reading books and independently solving problems, meticulously typing out each line of code. Additionally, I've enriched my understanding through a course from Fastcampus, an online learning platform. This course provided comprehensive insights into various algorithms, allowing me to tackle coding test problems effectively.

The books that I have followed are   

* 마스이 도시카츠 (2022). *가장 쉬운 독학 알고리즘 첫걸음 파이썬편*. (박광수 역). 동양북스. (원서출판 2020년).
* 박상길 (2020). *파이썬 알고리즘 인터뷰*. 책만.

And The course that I'm studying is
* 개발자 취업 합격 패스 With 코딩테스트, 기술면접 초격차 패키지 Online.
